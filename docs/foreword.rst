Philosophy
----------

Beerializer was developed with a few `PEP 20`_ idioms in mind.

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts.

All contributions to Beerializer should keep these important rules in
mind.

Prior art
---------

Beerializer is based on the awesome `R2DTO`_ serializing library by
`nickswebsite`_, also in public domain. A few notable changes were made,
though, including adjusted API design (Python's standard ``dump`` /
``load``, although in a slightly different context), model update support
and SQLAlchemy integration.
